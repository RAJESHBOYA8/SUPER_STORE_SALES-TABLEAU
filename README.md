## Superstore Sales Dashboard

I recently completed a Superstore sales dashboard using Tableau. This project showcases various data visualization techniques to provide insights into sales performance. The dashboard includes:

- *Tree maps*
- *Bar charts*
- *Pie charts*
- *Packed bubble charts*

This project allowed me to apply and enhance my skills in data visualization, making data-driven insights accessible and understandable.
